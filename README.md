Do you strongly dislike straightening your rolled-up uv islands in blender? Are you tired of having to use follow active quads to re-unwrap your curved uv islands to attempt to straighten them out? Well now you will never manually straighten your curved uvs again with SweetRollâ„¢!!!

Just select a vertex in the UV editor, right-click and select "Sweet (Un)roll" and your semi-circular uv strip will be straight in the blink of an eye!

Version 1.1.1
Works with Blender 3.0
